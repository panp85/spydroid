ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md
* build.xml
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => Spydroid\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => Spydroid\src\main\assets\
* libs\acra-4.4.0.jar => Spydroid\libs\acra-4.4.0.jar
* libs\android-support-v4.jar => Spydroid\libs\android-support-v4.jar
* libs\gcm.jar => Spydroid\libs\gcm.jar
* libs\GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.1.0.jar => Spydroid\libs\GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.1.0.jar
* libs\sc-light-jdk15on-1.47.0.2.jar => Spydroid\libs\sc-light-jdk15on-1.47.0.2.jar
* libs\scpkix-jdk15on-1.47.0.2.jar => Spydroid\libs\scpkix-jdk15on-1.47.0.2.jar
* libs\scprov-jdk15on-1.47.0.2.jar => Spydroid\libs\scprov-jdk15on-1.47.0.2.jar
* lint.xml => Spydroid\lint.xml
* proguard-project.txt => Spydroid\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => Spydroid\src\main\res\
* src\ => Spydroid\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
